### 🧪 Where AI Models Come to Face Their `RuntimeError`s

</div>

```ruby
class Reality < Exception
  def initialize
    super("Your model may be hallucinating benchmarks")
  end
end

begin
  puts "Running AI-generated code..."
  raise Reality if performance != promised_performance
rescue Reality => e
  puts "Welcome to our benchmarks!"
end
```

## 🔧 Requirements

```ruby
unless RUBY_VERSION >= "3.4.0"
  puts "⚠️ Hold up! We need Ruby 3.4+ for this party! ⚠️"
  exit
end

puts "✨ You're good to go! Let's benchmark some AI! ✨"
```

## 🚀 Features

```ruby
module BenchmarkFeatures
  class << self
    def automated_testing
      system("ruby main.rb") # One command to rule them all
    end

    def fair_competition
      models.each do |model|
        raise "No cheating!" if model.using_gpu?
        raise "Nice try!" if model.response_time < Time.now
      end
    end

    def metrics
      {
        speed: "⚡️ Microseconds matter",
        memory: "🧠 Every byte counts",
        complexity: "🤯 O(n) or go home",
        readability: "👀 Code so clean it squeaks"
      }
    end

    def transparency
      open_source = true
      results_public = true
      bias = nil # We don't do that here

      puts "Trust through code, not words" if open_source && results_public && bias.nil?
    end

    private

    def marketing_buzz
      raise NotImplementedError, "We prefer cold, hard benchmarks"
    end
  end
end

# No AI models were permanently harmed in the making of these benchmarks
# (They just learned some humility)
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone this beauty
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-benchmarks
cd llm-benchmarks

# Get the party started 🎉
bundle install

# Time to make AI models nervous
ruby main.rb

# See who survived
ruby bin/show_all_results
```

## 🏗️ Project Anatomy

```
